Game design plan

Name:maze scare

My game is going to be on the pc. It will be a puzzle game in which you will have to navigate a maze with the arrow keys whilst not touching the edge. I am going to use a square block or a picture of a human for the sprite.

When the player touches the edge the screen will change to a game over screen or something similar. However when they cross the finish line it will have a victory screen. The game will be challenging but not to hard. I will do this by:

* Making the gap between the sprite and the wall not to close but so they have to be accurate.

* Make it so if they hit the wall they have to restart

* The block will be roughly the same width as the maze path.

The game may have a time limit if the game is to easy and it may have more levels with challenges in them.

When you die there could be a picture or sound effect.

You will be given 3 lives to complete it

 It could also be a race

I will need to take the background out of the maze and I will have to make it so when they reach the finish line they will get a victory screen.
